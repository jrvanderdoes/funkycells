Vector of underlying functions for each in name.

\description{
This (internal) function is used to get the underlying functino (i.e. no _PC#
in it). This is used to centralize called from RandomForest_PC.R and
RandomForest_CVPC.R. If there is no PC (i.e. in meta-varaiables), the
meta-variable is returned.
