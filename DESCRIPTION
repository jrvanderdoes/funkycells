Description: Compare variables of interest between (potentially large
    numbers of) spatial interactions and meta-variables. Spatial variables
    are summarized using K, or other, functions, and projected for use in
    a modified random forest model. The model allows comparision of
    functional and non-functional variables to each other and to noise,
    giving statistical significance to the results. Included are
    preparation, modeling, and interpreting tools along with example
    datasets, as described in VanderDoes et al., (2023)
