Description: Analyzes many interactions to determine variables of interest in cells, markers, and related information, particularly focused on spatial effects. Implements a random forest model with functional and spatial data components. Includes data preparation, like K function summary, and implementation, allows for mutliple functional components from methods like FPCA.
