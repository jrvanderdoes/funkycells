The term funkycells comes from **fun**ctional **K** function
anal**y**sis of multiplexed images of **cells**. This package organizes
ways to analyze cell relationships based on their (empirical) K
functions. Approaches tailors to different data sizes are present in
this packages and we encourage all feedback and improvements through
this github repo.

If you would like to understand how to use funkycells, we recommend
viewing the vignette `vignette("funkycells")`, available in the package
or on the [website](https://jrvanderdoes.github.io/funkycells/).
