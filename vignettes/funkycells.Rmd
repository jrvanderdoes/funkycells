# Overview

```{r setup}
library(funkycells)
```

```{r define_functions, echo=FALSE}
full_run <- FALSE # This runs only computations that are feasibly quick
```

This documents a sample view of funkycells. Every function will be examined throughout this vignette, feel free to see the process from beginning to end or jumping to a given step in the document. Although each step in the funkycells process is addressed, detailed information on each function is left to their respective documentation.

# Data

This package is interested in investigating spatial data. Although potentially combined, in the most raw form the data of interest would be (1) cell information (locations, patient, image, etc.) and (2) meta-data (patient demographics, etc.).

Rather than loading in data, we will generate data with such properties. The cell data is constructed using `simulatePP()`, as given below. 
```{r simulate_cells}
set.seed(123)
cell_data <- simulatePP(
  cellVarData =
    data.frame(
      "stage" = c(0, 1),
      "A" = c(0, 0),
      "B" = c(1 / 100, 1 / 500),
      "C" = c(1 / 500, 1 / 250),
      "D" = c(1 / 100, 1 / 100)
    ),
  cellKappaData = 
    data.frame(
      "cell" = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
      "clusterCell" = c(NA, "A", NA, NA),
      "kappa" = c(20, 5, 15, 15)
    ),
  peoplePerStage = 40,
  imagesPerPerson = 1,
  silent = FALSE
)
```

We look at some pictures using `plotPP()`.
```{r plot_data}
plotPP(cell_data[cell_data$Image==1,c('x','y','cellType')],
       dropAxes = TRUE,
       colorGuide = 'none',
       xlim = c(0,1),
       ylim = c(0,1))
```

In funkycells we often explain the cell interactions using $K$ functions, although many functions are feasible. For example, K functions could be computed as the following function.
```{r compute_k}
k_data <- getKFunction(data=cell_data[cell_data$Person=='p1',-1],
             agents = c('A','A'),
             unit='Person',
             repeatedUniqueId = 'Image',
             rCheckVals = seq(0,0.25,0.01),
             xRange = c(0,1),
             yRange = c(0,1))
```

However, `funkyModel()` does not use functions directly, but the principle components of functions. Because of the commonness of $K$ functions, currently we implemented the steps in the same function^[This may be changed soon]. Although in our data, the cellTypes are in a single column, the functions accepts when the cell properties are defined in many columns (see documentation on `getKsPCAData()`). We also note that we only consider one-direction of the interactions to reduce variables and improve model power.
```{r compute_pca}
cells <- unique(cell_data$cellType)
cells_interactions <- rbind(data.frame(t(combn(cells,2))),
                            data.frame('X1'=cells,'X2'=cells))

pca_data <- getKsPCAData(
  data = cell_data, 
  outcome = 'Stage',
  unit = "Person",
  repeatedUniqueId = 'Image',
  rCheckVals = seq(0,0.25,0.01),
  agents_df = cells_interactions,
  xRange = c(0,1),  yRange = c(0,1),
  nPCs = 3)
```

Upon this data, we attach the meta information. For example, to this data we will add gender (with no effect), and age (with some effect).
```{r add_meta}
set.seed(123)
pcaMeta <- simulateMeta(pca_data,
                        outcome = 'Stage',
                        metaInfo = data.frame(
                           "var" = c("gender", "age"),
                           "rdist" = c("rbinom", "rnorm"),
                           "Stage_0" = c("0.5", "30"),
                           "Stage_1" = c("0.5", "31"))
                        )
```

# Model

We now jump into the model. We use `funkyModel()` as it employs cross-validation and permutation to create accurate models.
```{r funkyModel, eval=full_run}
set.seed(123)
model_fc <- funkyModel(data=pcaMeta,
                       outcome = 'Stage',
                       unit = 'Person',
                       metaNames=c('gender','age'))
```

The variable importance plot is returned (plot not shown as this was not run for computational reasons).
```{r variableimportance, eval=full_run}
model_fc$viPlot
```

The results of the model from `funkyModel()` also includes the model from `funkyForest()` on the original data, which is necessary when trying to predict new data. Suppose we create a few new people (i.e. get more data) and wish to predict. This would be done as follows.
```{r predict_data, eval=full_run}
set.seed(12345)
cell_data_pred <- simulatePP(
  cellVarData =
    data.frame(
      "stage" = c(0, 1),
      "A" = c(0, 0),
      "B" = c(1 / 100, 1 / 500),
      "C" = c(1 / 500, 1 / 250),
      "D" = c(1 / 100, 1 / 100)
    ),
  cellKappaData = 
    data.frame(
      "cell" = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
      "clusterCell" = c(NA, "A", NA, NA),
      "kappa" = c(20, 5, 15, 15)
    ),
  peoplePerStage = 2,
  imagesPerPerson = 2,
  silent = FALSE
)

pca_data_pred <- getKsPCAData(
  data = cell_data_pred, 
  outcome = 'Stage',
  unit = "Person",
  repeatedUniqueId = 'Image',
  rCheckVals = seq(0,0.25,0.01),
  agents_df = cells_interactions,
  xRange = c(0,1),  yRange = c(0,1),
  nPCs = 3)

set.seed(12345)
pcaMeta_pred <- simulateMeta(pca_data_pred,
                             outcome = 'Stage',
                             metaInfo = data.frame(
                               "var" = c("gender", "age"),
                               "rdist" = c("rbinom", "rnorm"),
                               "Stage_0" = c("0.5", "30"),
                               "Stage_1" = c("0.5", "31"))
                             )

predictions <- predict_funkyForest(model = model_fc$model, data_pred = pcaMeta_pred[-1])
```

# Other Investigations

We also can compare K functions by group.
```{r compare_k_functions}

ab_stage0 <- getKFunction(cell_data[cell_data$Stage==0,-1],
                    agents = c('A','B'),unit = 'Person',
                         repeatedUniqueId = 'Image',
                    rCheckVals = seq(0,0.25,0.01))
ab_stage1 <- getKFunction(cell_data[cell_data$Stage==1,-1],
                     agents = c('A','B'),unit = 'Person',
                         repeatedUniqueId = 'Image',
                     rCheckVals = seq(0,0.25,0.01))

ab_stage0_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data = ab_stage0,cols = K1:K15)
ab_stage1_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data = ab_stage1,cols = K1:K15)

data_k_plot <- rbind(data.frame('r'=ab_stage0_long$r,
                              'K'=ab_stage0_long$value,
                              'Unit'=ab_stage0_long$name,
                              'Outcome'="0"),
                   data.frame('r'=ab_stage1_long$r,
                              'K'=ab_stage1_long$value,
                              'Unit'=paste0(ab_stage1_long$name,'_1'),
                              'Outcome'="1"))

plot_K_functions(data_k_plot)
```

We can also consider ROC curves (Figure may not be shown due to computational reasons).
```{r compute_roc, eval=full_run}
pred_roc <- predict_funkyForest(
  model = model_fc$model,
  data_pred = pcaMeta[-2],
  data = pcaMeta[-2]
)
computePseudoROCCurves(pcaMeta$Stage, pred_roc$PredPerc[-1])
```

# Conclusion

There are many uses for funkycells, but we hope this gives a taste of the current functionality and aids in understanding of the documentation provided.
